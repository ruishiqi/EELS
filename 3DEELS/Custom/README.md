Custom functions should be placed in sub-folders of this folder. Processing functions should return an EELS class with an EELS class input. An example is given in `./Process/Bin2x2.m`, which bins the data by 2*2. Visualizing functions should return nothing with an EELS class input. Executables are directly evaluated with no input and no output. Similar rules apply for the `custom` folder in `4DEELS`.
